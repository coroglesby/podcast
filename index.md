Welcome to the University of Idaho Library's ***Podcasting Workshop!***  

Here, you'll find all the information you'll need to create a simple podcast (as well as some tips for taking that simple podcast to [the next level](LINK TO PAGE)).

<u><strong>A quick overview of what you'll find here:</strong></u>  
- Links to the (free!) software we recommend downloading
- How to capture and store the audio you'll be using
- How to edit the audio (i.e. trimming, cutting, and moving it around)
- Mixing the main audio with other audio (like voice-overs, music, etc.)
- How to bounce the finished project down to a simple, shareable audio file
