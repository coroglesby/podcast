# Recording Audio

{% capture text %}
Again, it's beyond the scope of this simple workshop to delve too far into the art of recording audio, but here are a few important tips for capturing audio (no matter how you're doing it)—
- **Stay near the microphone, and keep your proximity to it consistent**—If you're too far away from the microphone, you'll sound quieter, and vice versa. And if you're moving around too much, your audio will likely have subtle-to-significant fluctuations in volume. That said...
- **Keep an eye on your input levels**—Whether you're using a field recorder or recording directly into a digital workstation, you'll want to find and get familiar with the **volume unit (VU) meter**. Mostly, you'll want to make sure your signal isn't going into the red (which means your input level is too high/loud, and the audio will likely sound distorted), but you'll also want to make sure your signal isn't too low in the green (which of course means your signal is too quiet).
- **Try not to touch or move the microphone itself**-Find a comfortable position for you and your microphone and try to stick with it. You might see professional broadcasters moving the mic closer to their mouths every now and then for dramatic effect, but they have really, really nice recording setups that allow for that. That said, keeping the mic still can be tricky if, say, you're using a handheld field recorder for an interview and want to move it back and forth from you to your interviewee as you converse. If that's the case, just try to keep a good, consistent grip on the device, and be sure it's only being held by you (and not being passed back and forth between hands—you'd end up hearing that in the recorded audio, for sure).
- **

All that said, the best advice we can give is to mess around—experiment, try some practice recordings before your interview/voice-over, and see what you learn or observe. Every recording setup and environment is going to be different, so you'll need to get comfortable with your equipment and how it responds to the acoustic environment in which you'll be using it.

What's a podcast without a little background music? If you're looking to add a musical element to your podcast, be sure you own **the rights** to the music you use—or that you're using *royalty-free* content from sources such as:
- [YouTube's Royalty-free Music Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music?ar=2){:target='_blank'}—an enormous online database of **free**, downloadable music and sound effects.
- [Epidemic Sound](https://www.epidemicsound.com/creator-subscription/){:target='_blank'}—Free 30-day trial, then $15/month.
- [Free Stock Music](https://www.freestockmusic.com/){:target='_blank'}—Account required, but **free**.

**Note:** Be sure to still check whether or not the music you download from such sites requires attribution—it might be free to use and download, but sometime you still have to give credit to the original creator (and these sites will tell you if that's the case).

#### Getting it into Audacity

You probably guessed it: this is the same process as importing your original audio. That said, you'll want to create a new track for the music to live on all on its own so you can move it around in the mix when editing (which we're about to talk about in <a href="{{ '/content/2-Editing.html' | relative_url }}">the next section</a>.
